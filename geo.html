			<h3>Land use: </h3>
			
			<p>This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for three different types of land use: agricultural land, forest, and other; agricultural land is further divided into arable land - land cultivated for crops like <b>wheat, maize,</b> and <b>rice</b> that are replanted after each harvest, permanent crops - land cultivated for crops like <b>citrus, coffee, and rubber</b> that are not replanted after each harvest, and includes land under <b>flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, and permane</b> . . . more Land use field listing<br /><b>agricultural land:</b> 35.2% (2011 est.) <br /><b>arable land:</b> 27.6% (2011 est.)<br /><b>permanent crops:</b> 1.1% (2011 est.)<br /><b>permanent pasture:</b> 6.5% (2011 est.) <br /><b>forest:</b> 2.1% (2011 est.) <br /><b>other:</b> 62.7% (2011 est.)</p><br />
			
			<h3>Irrigated land: </h3>
			
			<p>This entry gives the number of square kilometers of land area that is artificially supplied with water. Irrigated land field listing 202,000 sq km (2012)</p><br />
			
			<h3>Population distribution: </h3>
			
			<p>This entry provides a summary description of the population dispersion within a country. While it may suggest population density, it does not provide density figures. Population distribution field listing<br />the Indus River and its tributaries attract most of the settlement, with <b>Punjab province</b> the most <b>densely populated</b></p><br />
			
			<h3>Natural hazards: </h3>
			
			<p>This entry lists potential natural disasters. For countries where <b>volcanic activity</b> is common, a volcanism subfield highlights historically active volcanoes. Natural hazards field listing<br />frequent <b>earthquakes</b>, occasionally severe <b>especially in north and west</b>; <b>flooding</b> along the Indus after <b>heavy rains</b> (July and August)</p><br />

			<h3>Area: </h3>
			
			<p>This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of all <b>land</b> and <b>water</b> areas delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of the surfaces of all inland water bodies, such as <b>lakes</b>, <b>reservoirs</b>, or <b>rivers,</b> as delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines. Area field listing<br /><b>total:</b> 796,095 sq km<br /><b>land:</b> 770,875 sq km<br /><b>water:</b> 25,220 sq km</p><br />
			
			<h3>Area - comparative: </h3>
			
			<p>This entry provides an area comparison based on total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of the Census.

			<h3>Land boundaries: </h3>
			
			<p>This entry contains the total length of all land boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous border countries. When available, official lengths published by national statistical agencies are used. Because surveying methods may differ, country border lengths reported by contiguous countries may differ. Land boundaries field listing<br /><b>total:</b> 7,257 km<br /><b>border countries (4):</b> <i>Afghanistan</i> 2670 km, <i>China</i> 438 km, <i>India</i> 3190 km, <i>Iran</i> 959 km</p><br />
			
			<h3>Coastline: </h3>

			<h3>Maritime claims: </h3>
			
			<p>This entry includes the following claims, the definitions of which are excerpted from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which alone contains the full and definitive descriptions: territorial sea - the sovereignty of a coastal state extends beyond its land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of sea, described as the territorial sea in the UNCLOS (Part II); this sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well as its . . . more Maritime claims field listing<br /><b>territorial sea:</b> 12 nm<br /><b>exclusive economic zone:</b> 200 nm<br /><b>contiguous zone:</b> 24 nm<br /><b>continental shelf:</b> 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin</p><br />
